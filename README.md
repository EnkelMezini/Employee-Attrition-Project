# 🧠 Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project explores the primary causes of employee attrition using IBM's HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset. Leveraging Python's data analysis libraries—particularly `pandas` and `scikit-learn`—the goal is to understand the underlying factors contributing to attrition and build a predictive model to identify at-risk employees.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze and visualize key features that influence employee attrition.
- Preprocess and clean the IBM HR dataset using `pandas`.
- Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict attrition risk.
- Provide actionable insights to help businesses improve employee retention.

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset used is the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). It contains 35+ features related to:

- Personal demographics
- Job roles and levels
- Compensation and satisfaction
- Performance and work-life balance

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `xgboost` (optional) for advanced model tuning

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and data types
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze correlations between features and attrition
   - Visualize high-impact factors using bar plots, heatmaps, and histograms

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create meaningful derived features
   - Normalize and scale data

4. **Model Development**
   - Train/test split
   - Fit classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Highlight top drivers of attrition
   - Suggest organizational strategies for retention

## 🔮 Key Findings

> _Example (update with actual results):_  
> - Job satisfaction and environment satisfaction were strong predictors of attrition.  
> - Employees with less than 3 years at the company and frequent job changes were more likely to leave.  
> - Work-life balance and overtime status had high influence on attrition outcomes.
